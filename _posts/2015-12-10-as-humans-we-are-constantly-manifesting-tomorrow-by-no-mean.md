Redefining the Future Ourselves
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7ebe27e5-254b-4bde-ad92-dc9927dac01c.jpg)

As the world moves towards a rapid increase of connectivity via more access to mobile devices, there is this assumption, that we _will _all be replaced by robots, and if that is the case, that it is a bad thing.

Right now the future is being created.  We cannot control the past, but we can control our actions of today and also, how we define the future.

Today, you still have the ability to "redefine the future". 

What do I mean by that?

As someone who has spent a lot of time around sci-fi authors, technologists, writers, futurist, and philosophers too, I can assure you, there is still a lot of space for us as a collective to define what happens in the future.

# As humans we are constantly manifesting tomorrow, by no means is the future of a product and our lives any different.

When it comes to manifesting a different life path for ourselves, we see subtle shifts on how we see our lives can shift the way we are headed.  On TV, we see how "the best product for x" can lure us to buy and create that reality too, well it is the same in regards to the broader future of our society. 

The future need not be one where technology owns us, but it can be one where **we make technology more human**, more about being seamlessly comfortable with us, versus us, being seamlessly comfortable with it. 

**How do we shift our mindsets when building tomorrow?  **

Well, that is what I hope to explore throughout my shares on this site.
